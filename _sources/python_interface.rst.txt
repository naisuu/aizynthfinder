Python interface
================

This page gives a quick example of how the tree search can be completed
by writing your own python interface. This is not recommended for most users.


1. Import the necessary class

.. code-block:: python

    from aizynthfinder.aizynthfinder import AiZynthFinder


2. Instantiate that class by providing a configuration file.


.. code-block:: python

    filename = "config.yml"
    finder = AiZynthFinder(configfile=filename)


3. Select stock and policy


.. code-block:: python

    finder.stock.select("zinc")
    finder.expansion_policy.select("uspto")
    finder.filter_policy.select("uspto")

`zinc` and `uspto` where the keys given to the stock and the policy in the configuration file.
The first policy set is the expansion policy and the second is the filter policy. The filter policy is optional.

4. Set the target SMILES and perform the tree search


.. code-block:: python

    finder.target_smiles = "Cc1cccc(c1N(CC(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2)c3ncon3)C(=O)C4CCS(=O)(=O)CC4)C"
    finder.tree_search()


5. Analyse the search tree and build routes


.. code-block:: python

    finder.build_routes()
    stats = finder.extract_statistics()


The ``build_routes`` method needs to be called before any analysis can be done.

The docstrings of all modules, classes and methods can be consulted :doc:`here <aizynthfinder>`


and you can always find them in an interactive Python shell using for instance:

.. code-block:: python

    from aizynthfinder.chem import Molecule
    help(Molecule)
    help(Molecule.fingerprint)
